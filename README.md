### W2
1，Because r, g, and b represent color values that range from 0.0 to 1.0. These are decimal values, like 0.3 or 0.85, so they need to be float.

int (integers) can only store whole numbers like 0, 1, or 2, not decimals.

bool (boolean) is only true or false, which isn’t useful for color amounts.

string is just text and can’t be used in math or color calculations.

So we use float to handle smooth color changes using decimal numbers.
